# Complexity-Measures-Consciousness-Analysis

## Overview
This repository hosts the code and resources used in the dissertation titled "Analyzing Complexity Measures in Diverse Dynamical Regimes to Understand States of Consciousness." The project focuses on using two primary complexity measures—Statistical Complexity (SC) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc)—to analyze neural states from both simulated models and real-world EEG data.

- **Note** that the real intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings are not publicly available due to legal constraints.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Odanson/Complexity-Measures-Consciousness-Analysis.git
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install required packages using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the analysis**:
    Use the provided Jupyter notebooks or scripts to replicate the analyses described in the dissertation.

## Usage
The code is structured to be modular and adaptable for various datasets. You can replace the provided data with your own neural recordings to explore the complexity measures in different contexts.

## Legal Notice
Please note that the iEEG recordings used in this study are not included in this repository due to legal restrictions. Researchers interested in similar data should refer to legally available datasets or contact appropriate sources.
