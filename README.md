# Complexity-Measures-Consciousness-Analysis
This repository contains code for analyzing complexity measures in states of consciousness, focusing on Statistical Complexity (SC) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc). It includes analysis scripts for both simulated and real-world intracranial EEG data, enabling replication of results and further exploration in neuroscience.
